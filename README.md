### 📂 Featured Projects.


#### 🍽️ [Food Delivery Time Prediction](https://github.com/bhavaniboini/B44_DA_048_Food_Delivery_TimePrediction)

* Built a machine learning model to predict **delivery time (in minutes)** for food orders using variables like **distance**, **traffic**, **weather**, and **courier experience**
* Conducted **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, and trained models such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**
* Achieved high accuracy with **Random Forest**, identifying key factors affecting delivery time
* Future scope includes **deployment using Streamlit** and integration with real-time order data
  


#### 🪖 [Warfare Losses: Analyzing the 2022 Conflict](https://github.com/bhavaniboini/B43_DA_040_The-Machine-Learning-Lab)

* Analyzed **military losses** during the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict using open-source data
* Performed **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **visualization** to understand trends in **troop**, **vehicle**, and **equipment** losses over time
* Identified peak periods of loss, correlations with battlefield events, and shifts in strategies using **time series** and **category-wise breakdowns**
* Visualized findings using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for better insights and storytelling
